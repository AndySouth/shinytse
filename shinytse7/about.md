This is one user interface for testing model functions. **Select tabs to the right on the navigation bar above to see what it does.**  

rtsetse follows from Hat-Trick, an Excel based Tsetse model developed by Glyn Vale see http://www.tsetse.org

This user interface uses the excellent [shiny](http://http://shiny.rstudio.com/)  package for R.
